## Setting the Course

| # | Question | Answer | RRS Reference / Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **28** | Gates should be about 5-8 boat-lengths wide. | **True** | **WS Race Management Manual J2.3**. (Standard recommendation is often 5-10 lengths depending on conditions). |
| **29** | Starting lines should be between 1 and 1.5 times the total length of the boats starting. | **True** | **WS Race Management Manual**. General guideline. |
| **30** | Higher performance boats need longer starting lines. | **True** | **WS Race Management Manual**. |
| **31** | In light air, the starting line should be longer. | **False** | **WS Race Management Manual**. Lines are often shorter in light air to help the RC see OCS. |
| **32** | Current parallel to the wind does not affect how the starting line should be set. | **False** | **WS Race Management Manual**. Current affects whether the fleet crowds the line or stays back. |
| **33** | "Apparent wind" is the wind that a drifting boat experiences. | **False** | **Theory and Race Management Manual L7.1**. True Wind is what a drifting boat feels (assuming no current). Apparent wind is felt by a moving boat. |
| **34** | When there is current across the course, the windward mark should be set to the apparent wind. | **False** | **WS Race Management Manual**. Marks are set to the *True Wind* (ground wind) axis. |

## Before the Start

| # | Question | Answer | RRS Reference / Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **35** | If the RC wants boats to come within hail, for example to check them in, it should display flag L. | **True** | **Race Signals**. |
| **36** | Unless the sailing instructions change the interval, the warning signal is made 5 minutes before the start. | **True** | **RRS 26**. |
| **37** | The visual signals for starting must be flags, unless changed by the sailing instructions. | **False** | **RRS 25.3**. Can be a flag or "object of a similar appearance". |

| **39** | The race committee is permitted to designate the course to be sailed with the preparatory signal. | **False** | **RRS 27.1**. Must be done by the *Warning* signal. |
| **40** | When the race committee designates the course to be sailed, it is required to display the direction to the first mark. | **False** | **RRS 27.1**. It must designate the *course*, compass bearing is optional but recommended. |
| **41** | The race committee is permitted to move a starting mark only until the preparatory signal. | **True** | **RRS 27.2**. |
| **42** | If flag Y is displayed (raised) after the warning signal, it imposes no requirements with respect to wearing adequate personal buoyancy. | **True** | **RRS 40.2**. Y must be displayed *before or with* the Warning signal. |
| **43** | The preparatory signal is made 5 minutes after the warning signal. | **False** | **RRS 26**. It is 1 minute after warning (4 mins before start). |
| **44** | Unless a starting penalty is to be in effect, the preparatory signal is a plain blue flag. | **False** | **Race Signals**. Flag P is standard (Blue with white square). |
| **45** | The preparatory signal is lowered 1 minute before the start, with one long sound signal. | **True** | **RRS 26**. |
| **46** | The race committee is permitted to abandon a race for any reason before the starting signal. | **True** | **RRS 27.3**. |

## Match Racing

| # | Question | Answer | RRS Reference / Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **48** | In match racing, the first signal in the starting sequence is the warning signal. | **False** | **RRS C3.1**. It is the **Attention** signal (Flag F, 7 mins prior). |
| **49** | In match racing, the time between the preparatory and starting signals is 4 minutes. | **True** | **RRS C3.1**. |
| **50** | In match racing, the race committee makes a sound signal 2 minutes before the starting signal... | **True** | **RRS C3.1**. End of pre-start entry time. |
| **51** | In match racing, one minute after lowering the answering pennant the RC should make the warning signal. | **False** | **RRS C3.2**. It makes the **Attention** signal. |
| **52** | While on station for the finish of a match race, the race committee is permitted to display a blue flag or shape. | **False** | **RRS C3.3**. "The race signal Blue flag or shape shall not be used." |

## Recalls

| # | Question | Answer | RRS Reference / Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **53** | A boat that is on the course side of the starting line before her starting signal must be scored OCS. | **False** | **Definition: Start**. She can return to the pre-start side. OCS applies if she is over *at* the signal. |
| **54** | A boat that is on the course side... is required to return to the pre-course side of the line by sailing across an extension... | **False** | **Definition: Start**. Only required if **Flag I** (Rule 30.1) is up. Otherwise, she can dip the line. |
| **55** | If more than one boat is OCS, the race committee should lower and re-raise flag X as each returns... | **False** | **RRS 29.1**. Keep it up until all return or 4 minutes pass. |
| **56** | When flag X has been displayed... it must remain displayed for four minutes. | **False** | **RRS 29.1**. Until all OCS boats return *OR* 4 minutes. |
| **57** | The race committee is permitted to signal a general recall if there has been an error in the starting procedure. | **True** | **RRS 29.2**. |
| **58** | If there are several OCS boats, the race committee should signal a general recall. | **False** | **RRS 29.2**. Only if they cannot *identify* them. |
| **59** | One minute after lowering First Substitute, the RC should make the warning signal. | **True** | **RRS 29.2**. |

## Starting Penalties

| # | Question | Answer | RRS Reference / Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **60** | A starting penalty signal (I, Z, U or black flag) must be displayed no later than the warning signal to be in effect. | **False** | **RRS 26**. It is the **Preparatory** signal (4 mins). |
| **61** | When the I flag penalty is in effect, flag X should be displayed immediately after the start if a boat is on the course side of either extension of the starting line. | **True** | **RRS 30.1, 29.1**. |
| **62** | If the race committee wishes to use flag U, the sailing instructions must say so. | **False** | **RRS 30.3**. It is in the rules as a standard signal. |
| **63** | Z flag penalties apply only if there is a general recall. | **False** | **RRS 30.2**. Applies even if the race continues. |
| **64** | A boat identified inside "the triangle" at one minute before her start when the Z flag penalty is in effect should be penalized 20%. | **True** | **RRS 30.2**. |

| **67** | If the race committee wishes to use the black flag, the sailing instructions must say so. | **False** | **RRS 30.4**. It is a standard rule. |
| **68** | Before using a black flag, it is a good practice to use flag I, Z, I over Z or U. | **True** | **Race Management Manual M3.6**. |
| **69** | If a race that was started under the black flag rule is abandoned... the race committee is required to display the sail numbers... | **True** | **RRS 30.4**. |

## During the Race

| # | Question | Answer | RRS Reference / Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **70** | A boat that contacts a starting mark after her preparatory signal and before starting breaks a rule. | **True** | **RRS 31**. |
| **71** | If a boat passes a rounding mark on the wrong side, she can correct that at any time. | **False** | **RRS 28.2**. She can correct it *before she finishes*. |
| **72** | After the starting signal, the race committee is permitted to abandon a race because light wind... | **True** | **RRS 32.1(b)**. |
| **73** | As soon as one boat has rounded the first mark, the race committee can no longer abandon the race. | **False** | **RRS 32.1**. Can abandon for safety/fairness at any time. |
| **74** | The race committee is permitted to shorten the course so that further scheduled races can be sailed. | **True** | **RRS 32.1**. |
| **75** | In order to shorten a race by eliminating one or more legs, the race committee is required to make the appropriate signals at the mark that begins the leg to the new finishing mark. | **False** | **RRS 32.2**. Shorten at the rounding mark (Gate or Mark). |
| **76** | Once any boat has sailed the course and finished, the race committee cannot abandon a race. | **False** | **RRS 32.1**. Can abandon if safety/fairness requires it. |
| **77** | The race committee is permitted to change the direction to the next mark or the length of the leg or both, even if the sailing instructions are silent on the subject. | **True** | **RRS 33**. |
| **78** | When signaling a change in the next leg of the course, the RC displays flag C and makes 2 sounds as the first boat approaches. | **False** | **RRS 33**. "Repetitive sounds" (not specifically 2). |
| **79** | If there are subsequent marks to be rounded after a "new" mark, they should also be "new" if they have been moved. | **True** | **RRS 33(c)**. To maintain course shape. |
| **80** | When a mark is missing, the race committee is permitted to substitute a boat displaying flag M for the mark. | **True** | **RRS 34(b)**. |

| **87** | A boat that is attached to a dock at her preparatory signal breaks a rule. | **False** | **RRS 45**. Exceptions allowed. |
| **88** | A boat that is anchored after her preparatory signal breaks a rule. | **False** | **RRS 45**. Exception allowed. |
| **89** | A boat that displays a private signal (a flag) while racing breaks a rule. | **False** | No RRS prohibits this unless Class Rules do. |
| **90** | If the race committee sees a boat pass a rounding mark on the wrong side, it can score her as DNF. | **False** | **RRS A5.1**. Score is **NSC** (Not Sailed Course). |
| **91** | If a race committee member on a mark boat sees a boat’s spinnaker contact a mark and the RC intends to protest, he must hail the boat immediately. | **False** | **RRS 60.2**. RC protests for incidents in the racing area require notification within the *protest time limit* (usually a notice on the board). |
| **92** | When a course is shortened, the finish line is between the staff displaying flag S and the nearby mark. | **False** | **RRS 32.2** Can be a gate also. |

## Finishing & Post Race

| # | Question | Answer | RRS Reference / Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **93** | Boats are required to completely cross the finishing line after finishing. | **False** | **Definition: Finish**. "Any part of her hull". |
| **94** | A boat starts, sails the course, finishes, and then immediately clearly hits the finishing mark. The RC should score her as DNF, without a hearing. | **False** | **RRS 60.2**. Must protest. She finished (Def Finish), then broke rule 31. |
| **95** | If the race committee is absent at the finish, to be scored as finishing, a boat shall note her finishing time and her finishing position in relation to any nearby boats and report them to the race committee as soon as reasonably possible.  | **?** | **?** |
| **96** | If any boat has properly sailed the course and finished within the time limit, the race committee is required to score all boats, including those that finish after the time limit, unless the race is abandoned. | **True** | **RRS 35**. |
| **97** | A boat doing penalty turns near the finishing line is required to sail completely to the course side of the finishing line before finishing. | **True** | **RRS 44.2**. |
| **98** | If a boat takes a scoring penalty, she is required to call the attention of the race committee to her flag at the finishing line. | **True** | **RRS 44.3(b)**. |
| **99** | A boat that hits the race committee finish boat’s anchor rode immediately after finishing has broken a rule. | **False** | **Definition: Mark**. Anchor lines are not part of the mark. |
| **100** | When finishing downwind flying a spinnaker, if the spinnaker is not in its normal position, the boat does not finish until some other part of the boat crosses the finishing line.  | **True** | **Definition: Finish**. "In normal position". |
| **101** | In match racing, a boat that owes a penalty before finishing is required to complete her penalty on the course side of the finishing line. | **True** | **RRS C7.2**. |
| **102** | A boat is not permitted to protest the race committee. | **True** | **RRS 60.1(a)**. Can only request redress. |
| **103** | The race committee is permitted to protest a boat under rule 2. | **True** | **RRS 60.2(a)**. |
| **104** | The race committee is permitted to protest a boat if a member of the race committee saw the boat hit a mark. | **True** | **RRS 60.2(a)**. |
| **105** | If a competitor from another boat tells the race committee that a boat has touched a mark, the race committee is permitted to protest the boat. | **False** | **RRS 60.2(b)**. RC cannot protest based on info from a competitor (conflict). |
| **106** | The race committee realizes after a race that it made a significant error. It is permitted to ask the protest committee to consider granting  redress to all of the boats involved.  | **True** | **RRS 61.1(b)**. |
| **107** | If the race committee observes misconduct by a competitor, it can report that to the protest committee, requesting action under rule 69. | **True** | **RRS 60.2(c) / 69.2**. |
| **108** | After the end of protest time, the RC learns that neither boat that was involved in a collision with serious damage delivered a protest or retired. It is too late to initiate action that will result in a valid protest.  | **False** | **RRS 60.2(a)**. RC can protest if valid reason for delay. PC can extend time. |
| **109** | A boat intending to protest because of an incident occurring in the racing area that she is aware of is required to report the protest (the name or sail number of the boat she is planning to protest) to the race committee at the finishing line.  | **False** | Only required if stated in SIs (Standard in Appendix S, but not RRS base). |
| **110** | If the race committee intends to protest a boat for hitting a mark, it has to hail “protest” and display a protest flag. | **False** | **RRS 60.4**. RC doesn't hail/flag; they post a notice. |
| **111** | If the race committee intends to protest a boat for hitting a mark, it must inform her after the race within the protest time limit. | **True** | **RRS 60.2(d)**. |
| **112** | If a race committee error causes a boat’s finishing place... to go from 80th to 81st, she is entitled to redress. | **True** | **RRS 61.4**. "Significantly worse" is subjective, but losing a place is valid grounds. |
| **113** | If the race committee fails to display flag X, boats scored OCS are entitled to redress. | **True** | **RRS 29.1 / 62.1(a)**. RC Error. |
| **114** | If the race committee corrects a scoring error and that moves a boat from 1st to 3rd place in a series, she is entitled to redress. | **False** | **RRS 90.3(c)**. Correcting an error is not an improper action. |
| **115** | If a boat intends to request redress due to an action of the race committee in the racing area, she must display her protest flag as soon as possible.  | **False** | **RRS 61.2**. Redress does not require a flag (unless SIs say so). |
| **116** | The time limit for delivering requests for redress is the same as for protests. | **False** | **RRS 61.2** Not exactly the same. |
| **117** | If the RC posts the scores after the protest time limit... the PC should find that the request is not timely. | **False** | **RRS 61.2(b)3**. Time limit extended if relevant info (scores) wasn't available. |

## Post Race: Appeals

| # | Question | Answer | RRS Reference / Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **122** | Merely by so stating in the notice of race and the sailing instructions, the organizing authority can deny the right of appeal at any event. | **False** | **RRS 70.3**. Only for specific reasons (Int'l Jury, essential qualifying, etc.) |
| **123** | Decisions made by a properly constituted International Jury cannot be appealed. | **True** | **RRS 70.3(a)**. |
| **124** | The only way an organizing authority can deny the right of appeal is to appoint an International Jury. | **False** | **RRS 70.3**. Can also deny if it's a qualifier or short series (with MNA approval). |
| **125** | A race committee is never permitted to appeal the decision on a protest. | **False** | **RRS 70.1**. Parties to a hearing can appeal. RC is a party if they brought the protest. |

## Post Race: Measurement

| # | Question | Answer | RRS Reference / Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **126** | A technical committee member who is not a competitor can be the protestor in a measurement protest. | **True** | **RRS 60.4**. |
| **127** | If the technical committee is going to protest a boat about her measurement, it should deliver a protest to the race office within two hours of the time it receives the relevant information. | **False** | **RRS 60.4(c)3**. If it first has to check equipment.. |
| **128** | A boat that has been disqualified in a measurement protest cannot race until the measurement problem is corrected. | **False** | **RRS 60.5(d)(2)**. the boat shall not race again... unless the protest committee decides... |
| **129** | When a boat cannot produce a required measurement or rating certificate, she is not permitted to race until she produces it. | **False** | **RRS 78.2**. She may race if she provides a signed statement to the RC, but must produce the certificate before the end of the event. |
| **130** | When a technical committee for an event reports to the race committee that a boat is not in compliance with her class rules, the race committee shall protest that boat. | **False** | **RRS 60.1**. The **Technical Committee** protests the boat directly. The RC is not required to do it for them. |
| **131** | Measurement protests by the technical committee are always valid. | **False** | **RRS 60.4**. They must still meet validity requirements (writing, time limits), though they are exempt from the "involved/witness" requirement of 60.2(a). |
| **132** | The protestor is required to pay the costs associated with determining the facts in a measurement protest. | **False** | **RRS 65.2**. The *unsuccessful party* pays the costs (unless the PC decides otherwise). |

| **135** | If people from another competing boat assist a capsized boat that is in danger, the capsized boat has broken a rule. | **False** | **RRS 41(a)**. Help for a crew in danger is permitted. |
| **136** | If an injured crew member is removed from a boat, the boat has broken a rule. | **False** | **RRS 48.2**. A person may leave the boat when ill or injured. |
| **137** | A boat is permitted to take more than one scoring penalty in the same race. | **False** | **RRS 44.3**. The rule implies a singular penalty calculation for the race ("The race score... shall be..."). |
| **138** | A boat that finishes 18th in a 20 boat fleet and accepts a 20% scoring penalty should be scored 22nd. | **False** | **RRS 44.3(c)**. "The penalty shall not cause the boat's score to be worse than the score for Did Not Finish." Max score is 21 (20+1). |
| **139** | If the first place finisher accepts a 20% scoring penalty, the second place finisher should be scored as finishing first. | **False** | **RRS 44.3(c)**. "The scores of other boats shall not be changed." |

| **150** | The number of races required to constitute a series must be stated in the sailing instructions. | **False** | **RRS A1**. It is stated in the Notice of Race (or SIs). Not strictly SIs only. |
| **151** | Boats that do not finish a race in a regatta are scored one point more than the last finisher in that race. | **False** | **RRS A5.2**. Scored one more than the number of boats *entered*. |
| **152** | For a series that is longer than a regatta, a boat that starts but does not finish a race is scored one point more than the last finisher in that race. | **True** | **RRS A5.3**. This rule (if applied) scores boats based on starters, not entries. |

| **156** | In the Low Point Scoring System, if a series tie cannot be broken on the basis of the number of firsts, seconds, etc., the tie stands (i.e., is not broken). | **False** | **RRS A8.2**. Broken by who beat whom in the *last race*. (Note: Previous test answer key might have been "True" based on older rules or misinterpretation, but RRS A8.2 mandates a tie break procedure. If A8.2 fails, then it stands, but A8.2 rarely fails). *Strict Study Guide Answer:* **False**. |
| **157** | The scoring abbreviation for a boat that is subject to rule 29.1 and does not thereafter start is PMS. | **False** | **RRS A10**. **OCS**. (PMS is obsolete). |
