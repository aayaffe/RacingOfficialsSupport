## Resailing, Restarting, and Abandonment: A Guide to Race Signals and Penalties

This table clarifies the differences between various forms of stopping and re-running a race under the **Racing Rules of Sailing (2025–2028)**, focusing on what happens to penalties and who is eligible to sail.

| Action | Signal | Timing | Definition & Purpose | Who Can Sail? | Status of Penalties (BFD, UFD, ZFP, Part 2) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Postponement** | **Flag AP** <br> (2 sounds) | Before the starting signal. | The scheduled start is delayed. The sequence stops and will restart later. | **All** boats entered in the series may participate in the new sequence. | **Reset.** <br> • **Z Flag (30.2)** penalties from that specific sequence are wiped. <br> • **U Flag / Black Flag** disqualifications do not happen because the start never occurred. |
| **General Recall** | **1st Substitute** <br> (2 sounds) | At the starting signal. | The Race Committee cannot identify all OCS boats or there was an error in procedure. The fleet returns to start again. | **YES, EXCEPT BFD.** <br> • Boats disqualified by the **Black Flag (30.4)** cannot restart. <br> • Boats scored **UFD (30.3)** *can* restart. | **Depends.** <br> • **UFD:** Wiped (Rule 30.3). <br> • **ZFP:** Stays (Rule 30.2). If the boat competes in the restart, the penalty applies to her score in that race. <br> • **BFD:** Stays (Rule 30.4). The boat is disqualified and cannot restart. |
| **Abandonment** | **Flag N** <br> (3 sounds) | Any time (usually after the start). | The race is declared void. It may be resailed later the same day or on another day. | **YES, EXCEPT BFD.** <br> • Boats disqualified by **Black Flag** in the abandoned race *cannot* sail the resailed race. <br> • Boats that were **DSQ** (e.g., from a protest) or **Retired** in the original race *can* sail the resailed race. | **See Rule 36:** <br> **Wiped:** <br> • Standard Part 2 penalties (collisions w/o damage). <br> • Touching marks (Rule 31). <br> • UFD (Rule 30.3). <br> <br> **Stays (Carries Over):** <br> • **BFD** (Rule 30.4). <br> • **ZFP** (Rule 30.2). <br> • **Rule 2** (Fair Sailing). <br> • **Rule 69** (Misconduct). <br> • **Rule 14** (Collision causing injury or serious damage). |


### Restarted vs. Resailed: The Context and Consequences

Based on **Rule 36 (Races Restarted or Resailed)** of the Racing Rules of Sailing (2025–2028), the distinction is primarily about the **context** of how the race was stopped, though the *consequences* for the sailors are largely the same.

#### **1. Restarted**
*   **Context:** This refers to a race that was stopped **at the start** or immediately after (e.g., via a **General Recall**).
*   **Scenario:** The race committee signals a General Recall because too many boats were over the line (OCS). The fleet returns, and the sequence begins again (restarts) immediately or shortly thereafter.
*   **Key Effect:** The race never really "happened" in terms of sailing the course. It is a fresh attempt to start the same race.

#### **2. Resailed**
*   **Context:** This refers to a race that was **Abandoned** (declared void) after it had already begun or even after it had been completed.
*   **Scenario:** A race is abandoned halfway through because of a thunderstorm or a missing mark (Rule 32.1), or a race is abandoned after the finish because of a successful request for redress regarding an improper action by the race committee. The race is then sailed again ("resailed"), potentially on a different day.
*   **Key Effect:** The original attempt is wiped from the scores (except for specific non-excludable penalties like Black Flag or Rule 69), and the race is run again from scratch.

### **Summary of the Difference**
*   **Restarted:** Stopped *during* the starting procedure (General Recall).
*   **Resailed:** Stopped *after* the race was underway or finished (Abandonment), and run again later.

**Under Rule 36**, both scenarios trigger the same principle: **"Clean Slate"**. A boat's score is wiped, and she can race again, *unless* she was disqualified under the Black Flag (Rule 30.4), Rule 69 (Misconduct), or Rule 14 (causing injury/serious damage).
